# ipad-pro-book-indesign-scripts

Javascript files used by myself to automatically update pages to an iPad Book. I'm working on.
These scripts enable me to swap out master pages with new ones I've created (to update book folio).
Automatically replace images of an iPad with the new iPad Pro.
Rename and save files.

If you're interested in using Javascript with InDesign there's a good reference to the Properties, Class and Methods here:

It's all work in progress. Feel free to copy anything here but test it carefully on unimportant files.
